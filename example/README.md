# example

The main example for [animated_vector](https://pub.dev/packages/animated_vector) and [animated_vector_gen](https://pub.dev/packages/animated_vector_gen).

It provides examples on how to use the data format to define animations directly with code ([digits.dart](./lib/digits.dart)) or on how to use the code generator for shapeshifter files ([custom.dart](./lib/custom.dart) and [assets](./assets/)).

The app can be ran on any platform and is [hosted live](https://hrx03.github.io/animated_vector/)
