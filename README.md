# animated_vector

## Description and inspiration
A package that adds support for vector data based animations.

The data format is heavily inspired from the AnimatedVectorDrawable from android, which allow for pretty flexible animations.

[This article](https://www.androiddesignpatterns.com/2016/11/introduction-to-icon-animation-techniques.html) was the main reason for developing this package, huge props to the author for the awesome resource.

## Support
The package should support every single platform as it doesn't depend on any platform specific implementation, it's completely dart and flutter.
In case you need any help with the package, head over to the [github issues page](https://github.com/PotatoProject/animated_vector/issues).

## Extras
You can use [ShapeShifter](https://shapeshifter.design) to create the animated vectors. Do note you'll need to manually convert the xmls to the dart format.

In the future i could add the flutter export functionality to ShapeShifter itself or parse the exported xml.
